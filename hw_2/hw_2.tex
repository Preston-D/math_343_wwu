\section*{Question 1}

Data with a rightward skew would produce a normal probability plot with a positive curvature.
Below is an example of a histogram that would produce a positively curved normal probability plot. \\


\begin{tikzpicture}
  \begin{axis}[
      ybar,
      ylabel={Frequency},
      xlabel={Value},
      ymin=0,
      axis lines*=left,
      % xtick=data,
      % nodes near coords,
      % nodes near coords align={vertical},
  ]
  \addplot[
      fill=blue!50,
      hist={
          bins=8,
          data min=0,
          data max=50,
      },
  ] table[row sep=\\,y index=0] {
      data \\

\section*{Question 2}

$H_0$: $\mu_1 - \mu_2 = 10$ \\
$H_a$: $\mu_1 - \mu_2 > 10$ \\

\begin{align*}
  Z &= \frac{\bar{y}_1 - \bar{y}_2 - 10}{\sqrt{\frac{\sigma_1^2}{n_1} + \frac{\sigma_2^2}{n_2}}} \\
    &= \frac{162.5 - 155 - 10}{\sqrt{\frac{1^2}{10} + \frac{1^2}{12}}} \\
    &= -5.838
\end{align*}

By observing that $Z_{\alpha} = 3.09$ we can conclude the following.
There is not enough statistical evidence to support the hypothesis that $\mu_1 - \mu_2 = 10$,
ie, the breaking strength of plastic 1 exceeds that of plastic 2 by at least 10 psi.
Therefore, based on the sample information, they should not use plastic 1.

\begin{align*}
  100(1-\alpha) \text{ C.I} = \bar{y}_1 - \bar{y}_2&\pm Z_{\alpha/2} \sqrt{\frac{\sigma_1^2}{n_1} + \frac{\sigma_2^2}{n_2}} \\
  7.5                       &\pm 3.29 \sqrt{\frac{1^2}{10} + \frac{1^2}{12}} \\
  7.5                       &\pm 1.40
\end{align*}

We are 99\% confident that the true value of $\mu_1 - \mu_2$ is between 6.1 and 8.9.
This is consistent with our above test which conlucded that the difference was not greater than 10.
\section*{Question 3}

    \caption{The output of the test for two variances from Minitab.}
    \label{fig:3_a}
  \end{figure}
  Since the P-value $> \alpha$ we can conclude the following.
  There is enough statistical evidence to support the hypothesis that both of the variances are equal.

\subsection*{b)}
\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{./images/3_b.png}
    \caption{The output of the two sample t test from Minitab. Assuming equal variances.}
    \label{fig:3_a}
  \end{figure}
  Since the P-value $= 0.962 > \alpha$ we can conclude the following.
  There is enough statistical evidence to support the hypothesis that the two means are equal.
\subsection*{c)}

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \begin{subfigure}[b]{0.4\textwidth}
        \includegraphics[width=1.25\textwidth]{./images/3_c_1.png}
        \caption{Minitab output showing the probability plot of type 1.}
      \label{fig:img1}
    \end{subfigure}

        \includegraphics[width=1.25\textwidth]{./images/3_c_2.png}

      \label{fig:img2}
    \end{subfigure}
    \label{fig:both}
  \end{figure}

  Note that for both Type 1 and Type 2, the hypothesis we will test is as follows, \\
  $H_0$: The data are drawn from a normal distribution. \\
  $H_a$: The data are not drawn from a normal distribution. 

\paragraph{Type 1} Since the P-value $= 0.409 > \alpha$ we can conclude the following.
    The evidence of the data is consistent with the hypothesis that the data are drawn from a normal distribution.

\paragraph{Type 2} Similarly, since the P-value $= 0.876 > \alpha$ we can conclude the following.
    The evidence of the data is consistent with the hypothesis that the data are drawn from a normal distribution.

\subsection*{a/b)}

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{./images/5_a_1.png}
  \caption{The output of the paired t test from Minitab.}
  \label{fig:5_a}
\end{figure}
Since the P-value $= 0.674 > \alpha$ we can conclude the following.
There is enough statistical evidence to support the hypothesis that the two means are equal.

\subsection*{c)}

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{./images/5_a.png}
  \caption{The output of the paired t test containing the confidence interval from Minitab.}
  \label{fig:5_a}
\end{figure}
From the above confidence interval we can conclude the following.
We are 95\% confident that the true difference between the population means is between -0.001 and 0.001.

We can also note that the confidence interval contains 0, which is consistent with our hypothesis test.

                data:  b1
                W = 0.84597, p-value = 0.05201
\end{lstlisting}

Since the P-value $= 0.05201 > \alpha$ we can conclude the following.
    The evidence of the data is consistent with the hypothesis that the data are drawn from a normal distribution.

                Shapiro-Wilk normality test

                W = 0.92972, p-value = 0.4452
\end{lstlisting}

Since the P-value $= 0.4452 > \alpha$ we can conclude the following.
    The evidence of the data is consistent with the hypothesis that the data are drawn from a normal distribution.


\subsection*{b)}

\begin{lstlisting}[language=R, caption=R output of a paired t test, basicstyle=\small]
                Paired t-test

                data:  b1 and b2
                t = -0.36577, df = 9, p-value = 0.723
                alternative hypothesis:
                    true mean difference is not equal to 0
                95 percent confidence interval:
                    -0.3664148  0.2644148
                sample estimates:
                mean difference 
                    -0.051 
\end{lstlisting}

The confidence intercal on the difference in mean score leads us to the following conclusion.
We are 95\% confident that the true difference in the population means is between -0.36 and 0.26.
Since the confidence interval contains 0, we can also conclude that the two sample means may be equal.

\subsection*{c)}

\begin{flushleft}
  $H_0$: $\mu_1 = \mu_2$ \\
  $H_a$: $\mu_1 \neq \mu_2$ \\
\end{flushleft}

Since the P-value $= 0.723 > \alpha$ we can conclude the following.
There is enough statistical evidence to support the hypothesis that the sample means are equal,
ie, $\mu_1 = \mu_2$.
