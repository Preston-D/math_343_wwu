$H_0$: All means are equal. \\
$H_a$: Not all means are equal. \\

\end{figure}
Performing an F test at we can see that the P-value$ = 0.000 < \alpha = .05$, therefore we can conclude the following.
There is enough statistical evidence to support the hypothesis that not all means are equal.

    \caption{The Boxplot of tensile strength of the One-way ANOVA test from Minitab.}
    \label{fig:2_b}
\end{figure}
Judging by the boxplot alone, It would seem that the means are significantly different.
This is consistent with the above hypothesis test.
It looks as though the mean for treatment 1 and treatment 3 could be similar, in a pairwise comparison.
\subsection*{c)}
The results of the Fisher's LSD test can be summarized in the graphical results below.
Note that a line under the treatments indicate that they are not significantly different. \\

\begin{flushleft}
$H_0$: The data are drawn from a normal disribution. \\
$H_a$: The data are not drawn from a normal disribution. \\
\end{flushleft}
Since the P-value is very large (0.890), we can conclude the following. 
The evidence of the data is consistent with the data being drawn from a normal disribution.

\subsection*{e)}

    \caption{The residuals versus the predicted tensile strength from Minitab.}
    \label{fig:2_e}
\end{figure}
This graph indicates that there is not heteroskedasticity present,
that along with the conclusion that the data is drawn from
a normal distribution indicates that the model assumptions are verified
and the hypothesis test is valid.

$H_0$: All means are equal. \\
$H_a$: Not all means are equal. \\
Performing an F test at we can see that the P-value $ = .052 > \alpha = .05$, therefore we can conclude the following.
The evidence from the data is consistent with the hypothesis that all means are equal.

\subsection*{b)}
Given that the F test concluded that all means are equal, It should not matter what fluid is selected given that the objective is long life.
That being said, if forced to choose, I would pick fluid 3, as it had the highest sample mean at $\bar{y}_{3 \cdot} = 20.95$.

\end{flushleft}
Performing an Anderson Darling normality test at $\alpha = 0.05$ on the residuals gives a P-value of 0.526.
Since the P-value is larger than $\alpha$, we can conclude the following. 
The evidence of the data is consistent with the data being drawn from a normal disribution.

Observing the residuals shows no indication of heteroskedasticity. This, along with the normality test indicates that the
basic analysis of variance assumptions are satisfied.
