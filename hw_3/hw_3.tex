\end{figure}
Performing an F test at we can see that the P-value$ = 0.000 < \alpha = .05$, therefore we can conclude the following.
There is enough statistical evidence to support the hypothesis that not all means are equal.

    \label{fig:2_b}
\end{figure}
Judging by the boxplot alone, It would seem that the means are significantly different.
This is consistent with the above hypothesis test.
It looks as though the mean for treatment 1 and treatment 3 could be similar, in a pairwise comparison.
\subsection*{c)}
The results of the Fisher's LSD test can be summarized in the graphical results below.
Note that a line under the treatments indicate that they are not significantly different. \\

\begin{flushleft}
$H_0$: The data are drawn from a normal disribution. \\
$H_a$: The data are not drawn from a normal disribution. \\
\end{flushleft}
Since the P-value is very large (0.890), we can conclude the following. 
The evidence of the data is consistent with the data being drawn from a normal disribution.

\end{figure}
This graph indicates that there is not heteroskedasticity present,
that along with the conclusion that the data is drawn from
a normal distribution indicates that the model assumptions are verified
and the hypothesis test is valid.

$H_0$: All means are equal. \\
$H_a$: Not all means are equal. \\
Performing an F test at we can see that the P-value $ = .052 > \alpha = .05$, therefore we can conclude the following.
The evidence from the data is consistent with the hypothesis that all means are equal.

\subsection*{b)}
Given that the F test concluded that all means are equal, It should not matter what fluid is selected given that the objective is long life.
That being said, if forced to choose, I would pick fluid 3, as it had the highest sample mean at $\bar{y}_{3 \cdot} = 20.95$.

Performing an Anderson Darling normality test at $\alpha = 0.05$ on the residuals gives a P-value of 0.526.
Since the P-value is larger than $\alpha$, we can conclude the following. 
The evidence of the data is consistent with the data being drawn from a normal disribution.

Observing the residuals shows no indication of heteroskedasticity. This, along with the normality test indicates that the
basic analysis of variance assumptions are satisfied.

\subsubsection*{95 percent confidence interval estimate on
the mean life of battery brand 2.}
In order to construct a 95 percent confidence interval estimate on
the mean life of battery brand 2. The following equation can be used. \\
\begin{equation*}
    \sum_{i=1}^{a} c_i \bar{y}_{i \cdot} - t_{\alpha/2, N-a} \sqrt{\frac{MSE}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{a} c_i^2}
    \leq \sum_{i=1}^{a} c_i \mu_i \leq
    \sum_{i=1}^{a} c_i \bar{y}_{i \cdot} + t_{\alpha/2, N-a} \sqrt{\frac{MSE}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{a} c_i^2}
\end{equation*}
\begin{flushleft}
The contrast of intrest, where $c_1 = 0, c_2 = 1, c_3 = 0$, and $a = 3$ is:
\end{flushleft}
\begin{align*}
    \Gamma &=  \sum_{i=1}^{a} c_i \bar{y}_{i \cdot} \\
                &= 0(95.2) + 1(79.4) + 0(100.4) \\
                &= 79.4 
    \end{align*}
\begin{flushleft}
  Using R, the following values were obtained. $MSE = 1315.7$, and $t_{\alpha/2,N-a} = t_{0.025,12} = 2.178$.
  Thus, the 95 percent confidence interval estimate on
  the mean life of battery brand 2 is:
\end{flushleft}
\begin{align*}
  79.4 - 2.178 \sqrt{\frac{1315.7}{5} \cdot 1}
  &\leq \sum_{i=1}^{a} c_i \mu_i \leq
  79.4 + 2.178 \sqrt{\frac{1315.7}{5} \cdot 1} \\
  44.06
  &\leq \sum_{i=1}^{a} c_i \mu_i \leq
  114.73 \\
\end{align*}

\subsubsection*{99 percent confidence interval estimate on the mean difference between the lives of battery brands 2 and 3.}
The contrast of intrest, where $c_1 = 0, c_2 = 1, c_3 = -1$, and $a = 3$ is:
\begin{align*}
    \Gamma &=  \sum_{i=1}^{a} c_i \bar{y}_{i \cdot} \\
                &= 0(95.2) + 1(79.4) + -1(100.4) \\
                &= -21 
    \end{align*}
\begin{flushleft}
    Using R, the following values were obtained. $t_{\alpha/2,N-a} = t_{0.005,12} = 3.054$.
    Thus, the 99 percent confidence interval estimate on the mean difference between the lives of battery brands 2 and 3 is:
\end{flushleft}
\begin{align*}
    -21 - 3.054 \sqrt{\frac{1315.7}{5} \cdot 2}
    &\leq \sum_{i=1}^{a} c_i \mu_i \leq
    -21 + 3.054 \sqrt{\frac{1315.7}{5} \cdot 2} \\
    -91.06
    &\leq \sum_{i=1}^{a} c_i \mu_i \leq
    49.06 \\
\end{align*}
